// Native Pi slash commands for The Librarian — optional sugar (rethink D9).
//
// Four thin prompt templates aligned with docs/slash-commands.md and the
// 7-verb surface. Each handler injects a user message that drives the LLM
// through the corresponding tool flow; the tools (and the primer) carry the
// actual protocol, so these stay deliberately skeletal. Pi's `registerCommand`
// is one call per verb — cheap enough to keep.
